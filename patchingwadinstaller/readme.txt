This programm loads RVL-mios-v5.wad.out.wad patches it and install it.
If Gamecube mode is entered,  the application "start.dol" which was previously loaded from front SD port is started.
CAUTION: If Gamecube discs are still working is not tested. But it should work.

The program let you choose to:
A: Install patched version of MIOS
B: Install unpatched version of MIOS

CAUTION: I don't have a gamecube disc, so I can't say if gamecube disc is working again, when installing original version. But it should work as before.

I have tested this with some gamecube homebrew on a EU/PAL console. The graphic mode is sometimes incorrect.
